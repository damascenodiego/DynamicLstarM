# Learning to Reuse

This folder contains the laboratory package from the work entitled *Learning to Reuse:  Adaptive Learning for Evolving Systems* that has been accepted as full paper at the [15th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2019)](https://ifm2019.hvl.no/).

This repository is organized as follows:

In folder **[Benchmark](https://github.com/damascenodiego/DynamicLstarM/tree/master/mealyInference/Benchmark)**, we have a set of subject systems for benchmarking automata learning algorithms. These are Mealy machines specified in the kiss format.

In folder **[Experiments/2019_02_iFM](https://github.com/damascenodiego/DynamicLstarM/tree/master/mealyInference/Experiments/2019_02_iFM)**, we have the results for our experiments from the iFM'19 paper. In this folder, we have included our raw and tabulated results, plots, Bash scripts for running the experiments, and R scripts for statistical analysis.
